    <h1>LilyPad——Your Skillful Helper For Interactive Wearables</h1>
    <h2>By Yiting Deng</h2>

    <p>
      The LilyPad is a sewable approach within the Arduino system. It was designed by Leah Buechley, who worked as an associate professor at the MIT Media Lab(2009-2013) and directed the High-Low Tech research group. Leah developed LilyPad as well as other
      smart textiles and soft circuit solutions. The LilyPad system provides a wonderful and easy approach for those who are interested in crafting, fiber arts and technology, allowing users to build soft, interactive e-textile projects.

      <br><br> The LilyPad system contains several traditional component in Arduino, but made in a much thinner and sewable way. There’s LilyPad Arduino, LilyPad RGB LEDs, LilyPad Buttons and Switches, LilyPad Sensors(temperature sensor and light sensor),
      LilyPad Prototype board and LilyPad battery holder. Each of them is only a few grams light, and has large sew tabs which are conductive and allowing conductive threads to sew on. They all come in round-shape, with sew tabs all around, creating more
      space for connection. Conductive threads are the only needed component for circuit connection, which works perfectly for a soft circuit project. The LilyPad Arduino Main Board is based on the ATmega 168V, which requires the same programming skills
      of regular Arduinos.
      <br><br> Using the LilyPad is more like making traditional craft work. It not only creates new solution for design technologist, but also for people who are more interested in craft and have little knowledge for interactive technology to dig in.
      To start with LilyPad, you only need to know the basic physics principles: To connect a simple circuit with LEDs, battery, circuit(soft sewing threads) and switch. The finishing of LilyPad projects are more crafted-skills required, which requires
      you to sew a protective layer on the existing conductive circuit(the conductive thread circuit). To finish the project, you can either embroider, add another layer of fabric, or applying fabric paints which are all crafted in their traditional ways.
      <br><br> Another reason for using the LilyPad is that it is very cheap and affordable, but works in excellent results. A single LilyPad Arduino USB cost $25.95 on Sparkfun, which is a similar price to the regular Arduino. LEDs are $2.95 for five
      pieces, buttons are $1.95 for each, and battery holders for $1.95 each. Although the price for LilyPad products are relatively low, but it doesn’t looks “cheap” after you finish your project which a lot of fashion designer will be really cared of.
      After applying a layer of traditional embroidery, a LilyPad clothing project can be pretty couture-styled, with interactive electronic elements flowing. Also, though the LilyPad can be simply programmed, it has tons of possibilities to combine,
      to develop, to create copious interactive effects.
      <br><br> Lastly, LilyPad is a wonderful system that is approachable for all-aged and all gender. Having a lovely, lavender appearance as well as simple crafting instructional kits, it is a great tool to introduce interactive electronic concepts
      to young kids. Also, it encourages more girls or women to start with electronic projects, which might normally be less attractive for them. Using the LilyPad is a affordable and fun way to work with technology and traditional craft in the same time,
      but have numerous possibilities waiting for you to create.
